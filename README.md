# Upgrade Your Databricks RAG Demos ðŸ˜Ž

Are you tired of putting in a ton of effort on your RAG application only to be left with a mediocre Gradio app (or worse, just a regular ole notebook!) to show off all your hard work... Me too!

That's why I created this repo. With Lakehouse Apps and Chainlit, it's easy to:
* Stream responses
* Maintain session history for a better chat experience
* Visualize steps taken in your chain
* Get cited sources
* Quickly swap out different models

In order to deploy this app for your own RAG use case, all you need to do is swap out the info in `app/vector_search.py` to point to your Vector Search index. But also, feel free to customize and make it your own!
